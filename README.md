RoadSense AI – Road Accident Severity App
RoadSense AI is a mobile application built as a B.Tech 4th year project to help categorize road traffic accidents by severity and support faster emergency response. The app allows a user to enter key accident details and returns a predicted severity level using a trained machine learning model.​

Objectives
Predict the severity of a road accident (for example: minor, serious, fatal) from structured input features such as time, location, vehicle type, road and weather conditions.​

Provide a simple Android interface that can be used by traffic police or control‑room operators.

Demonstrate an end‑to‑end workflow: data preprocessing, model training, API deployment, and mobile app integration.

Tech Stack
Frontend / Mobile: React + TypeScript, Capacitor (Android)

Build tools: Node.js, npm, Capacitor CLI, Android Studio​

Features
Form to capture accident details (time, location, road type, weather, vehicle information, etc.).​

Basic history/log of previous predictions 

Android APK generated with Capacitor and Android Studio for deployment on real devices.​
“This project was initialized using Google’s AI Studio repository template. All app logic, UI, and integration with the accident severity model were designed and implemented by me as part of my B.Tech final year project.”
